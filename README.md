# startup_scripts
<h3>Scripts ran on startup for personal Windows 10 computers  </h3>
Personalised (but customisable) for 3 functional scripts to run:  
<li> WorkLogger.ahk (to log all work performed on the computer) Found here: https://github.com/staid03/WorkLogger
<li> MinimizeToTrayMenu_minimise.ahk (Internet downloadable as MinimiseToTray.ahk)  
<li> Multipurpose-home.ahk (a bunch of shortcut actions including my method of taking screenshots and opening them in MSPaint)  Found in this repository.
<br>
<br>
I have placed startup_script.ahk and the other 3 scripts into C:\Scripts\Startup\ and then created a shortcut to startup_script.ahk and located it in my startup folder for All Users.
